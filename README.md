Trivia game (Northwestern Coding Boot Camp assignment)

## Do you think you're a true Harry Potter fan?

* Press Start to play and see if you can get all **10 trivia questions** right.

* You'll have a generous 30 seconds to answer each question. Run out of time, and you'll have to move on to the next one.

* Whether you're right, wrong or took too long, you'll be treated to a ~fun gif~ after each question!

### Good luck!
